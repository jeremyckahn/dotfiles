# Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use and live by.  Perhaps you will find them useful too!

To set up Linux:

```sh
sudo apt install make
git clone https://github.com/jeremyckahn/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make install_linux
```

To set up MacOS:

```sh
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/jeremyckahn/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make install_macos
```
